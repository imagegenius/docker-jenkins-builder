## Updating the Container

Most of our images are static, versioned, and require an image update and container recreation to update the app. We do not recommend or support updating apps inside the container. Check the [Application Setup](#application-setup) section for recommendations for the specific image.

Instructions for updating containers:

### Via Docker Compose

* Update all images: `docker-compose pull`
  * or update a single image: `docker-compose pull {{ project_name }}`
* Let compose update all containers as necessary: `docker-compose up -d`
  * or update a single container: `docker-compose up -d {{ project_name }}`
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`

### Via Docker Run

* Update the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/{{ ig_project_name_short }}/{{ project_name }}:{{ release_tag }}`
* Stop the running container: `docker stop {{ project_name }}`
* Delete the container: `docker rm {{ project_name }}`
* Recreate a new container with the same docker run parameters as instructed above (if mapped correctly to a host folder, your `/config` folder and settings will be preserved)
* You can also remove the old dangling images: `docker image prune`
